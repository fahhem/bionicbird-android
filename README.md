bionicbird-android
==================

Quick and dirty Bionic Bird Android app.

It uses Evothings, so you'll have to install that first:

[Evothings android client](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.evothings.evothingsclient)

Then, you can use the hosted version in one of two ways:

* [Click this on your Android browser](evothings://evo.fahhem.com/bionicbird)
* Enter this as the address in the Evothings client: http://evo.fahhem.com/bionicbird
